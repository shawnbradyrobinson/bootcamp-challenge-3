The application has a sleek, minimal design, with eye-catching visual cues for interacting with the interface. 

Upon pressing the "Generate Password" button, users will be prompted to choose a password of any length between 8 and 128 characters.

From there, they are able to select whether they want their password to be comprised of lowercase, uppercase, numerical, or special characters -- as well any combination of these!
